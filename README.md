(The following description is from our itch.io page: https://chronoblossom.itch.io/beginners-guide-to-good-ghost-hunting)

It's your first job as a ghost hunter!

When your team consists of an overexcited ghost fanatic, someone who really doesn't want to be here, and a vehement non-believer, tracking down a ghost isn't very easy. Equipped with the latest Ghyson Vacuum backack, an EMF meter, a ghost phone, a video camera, a good amount of crucifixes and a handful of salt; this ghost hunting team guarantees your (abandoned) house ghost-free, or your money back! But...Where is this ghost hiding? And why does this house seem so much bigger on the inside?
